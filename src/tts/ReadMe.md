# Piper TTS Setup

## Install Piper

```bash
pip install piper-tts
```

## Download voices

1. Create a folder named `voices` in the project root.
2. Download the ONNX voices configured in `config.yaml` (default + persona voices).
3. Place the downloaded files into the `voices` folder.

WAV files are then generated by the TerminalUI automatically when TTS is enabled.
